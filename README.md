## Introduction

The ATM Interface in Java (Console Based Application) is designed to simulate an automated teller machine (ATM) experience. The project consists of five classes: account holder, account, bank transaction, bank, and the specific ATM of the bank. The system provides user authentication, account management, transaction history, and various banking functionalities.

## Technologies Used

- Java
- Eclipse IDE
- MySQL
- JDBC
- Maven
- Git

## Functionalities

1. User Authentication: Users are prompted to enter their user ID and PIN for authentication. Upon successful authentication, they gain access to the ATM functionalities.

2. Show Transaction History: Users can view their transaction history, which provides details of their past transactions such as withdrawals, deposits, and transfers.

3. Withdraw: Users can withdraw cash from their account by specifying the desired amount. The system verifies the availability of funds and updates the account balance accordingly.

4. Deposit: Users can deposit money into their account by entering the amount they wish to deposit. The system records the transaction and updates the account balance accordingly.

5. Transfer: Users can transfer funds from their account to another user's account. They need to provide the recipient's account details and the desired amount to be transferred. The system ensures the validity of the transaction and updates the account balances of both parties involved.

6. Quit: Users have the option to exit the ATM interface, concluding their banking session.
